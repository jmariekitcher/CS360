# CS360 - Jacquelin Kitcher


The requirements and goals for the Event Tracking app that I developed were to create an app where a user can add event details to including the name, description and date of the event and display it to the user. I was to include a way to add/edit/remove events, and notify the user on the date of the event. Additionally, the app needed to have a login screen that accepted a username and password, a login button that took you to the main dashboard of the app upon clicking, and the ability to create a new user. 

The process I used to code my app involved re-visiting the sample apps that we used in the Zybooks text, and playing around with the layout files to get it to look how I wanted it. I also had to interpret the requirements of the project by breaking down the process piece by piece, which involved a lot of different classes and layout files. 

The way that I tested that the code was functional was by using the emulator, and debugging as I wrote the code. The emulator helped me figure out which formatting components were missing, and what I needed to change. For example, upon logging in, the login page sent me to a weird generic page that had mock info, instead of my dashboard. I had to review the code until I realized that the login page was not referencing the right class, so the database wasn't appearing. I initially just though there was something wrong with the database class code itself, and I spent a lot of time trying to figure it out. 

I think the components I was successful in while creating this app were the use of buttons, including the floating action button. I also think I did a good job of creating an app that I researched and planned to make, even if it wasn't as pretty as the prototype.
